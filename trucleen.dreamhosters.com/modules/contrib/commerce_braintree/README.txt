Requirements
============

Drupal 8.x (https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install)
Commerce 2.x (https://docs.drupalcommerce.org/commerce2)
Commerce Braintree module (https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_braintree)
Braintree Merchant Account (https://www.braintreepayments.com/)

Installation
============

1. Download, install, and enable the following to your sites modules directory.
	Check https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install/step-2-install-dependencies-with-composer
	for more instructions on how to install dependencies with composer in Drupal 8

	With Composer installation of any module and automatic download of libraries is done with command "composer require drupal/module_name"
	composer require drupal/commerce_braintree

	Enable Braintree module - Extend
	(admin/modules)

	Add Braintree as Payment gateway - Commerce > Configuration > Payment > Payment gateways > Add Payment Gateway
	(admin/commerce/config/payment-gateways)


2. To proceed to next step you will need Braintree merchant account

  Create or gather your Braintree website login credentials.
    https://www.braintreepayments.com

    a. Create a sandbox account for testing via
       https://www.braintreepayments.com/get-started

    b. Create a production account for going live via
       https://signups.braintreepayments.com/


 Log into Braintree using either the production or sandbox login options
     to get you API keys for this module.

     Gather the following credentials by visiting Account > My User > View API Keys.
     Click on the 1st (and likely only) public key link to view the key details.
     Note: The order they are displayed does not match the order they are entered
           in Drupal. Pay attention! :)

     * Merchant ID
     * Public key
     * Private key

     Next, you'll need the Merchant account ID (not the same as Merchant ID above).
     You can find this by going to  Account > Merchant Account Info

     Merchant account ID's are tied to currencies and should match the
     currencies you have enabled on your Drupal Commerce store. If you only have one
     currency then grab the only Merchant account ID listed in Braintree.
     Otherwise, make sure you match these up correctly.

     To create new Merchant account ID go to Account > Merchant Account Info > New Merchant Account

Enable Payment Methods

	To enable PayPal Payment Method go to Settings > Processing Options and toggle the switch

Select Payment method types you want to be available in your store

	 Credit card
	 PayPal Express
	 PayPal Credit

Testing
=======

To test your implementation, add a product to your cart, proceed thorough checkout
and enter a credit card. We recommend using a sandbox account for this before
attempting to go live. If you're using a sandbox account, you can use the following
credit card to test a transaction

###### Visa Card
Credit Card #: 4111 1111 1111 1111
Expiration Date: Any 4 digit expiration greater than today's date
CVC (if enabled): Any 3 digit code

###### Master Card
Credit Card #: 5555555555554444
Expiration Date: Any 4 digit expiration greater than today's date
CVC (if enabled): Any 3 digit code

###### American Express
Credit Card #: 378282246310005
Expiration Date: Any 4 digit expiration greater than today's date
CVC (if enabled): Any 3 digit code

###### Discover
Credit Card #: 6011000991300009
Expiration Date: Any 4 digit expiration greater than today's date
CVC (if enabled): Any 3 digit code

Note about currencies
=====================

You must configure your Braintree account on the Braintree website to accept all
currencies that your Commerce store accepts.

If you do not do this, Commerce orders will be charged at the default currency of your
Braintree account regardless of what currency is shown in your store (for example,
if a product in your store has a price of 10,000 JPY, but your Braintree account is only
set up to handle USD, then the price charged to your customers will be 10,000 USD,
not 10,000 JPY).

You can learn more about currency handling on the Braintree website:

Note about credit card types
============================
As per Braintree documentation found in here - https://articles.braintreepayments.com/get-started/payment-methods#credit-cards
Braintree’s US merchant accounts bundle Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB, and
sometimes American Express as the default accepted payment types. Most of
Braintree’s international merchant accounts bundle Visa and Mastercard as the
default accepted payment types. If you need to enable more credit card types you
have to raise a support request with Braintree
